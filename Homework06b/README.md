Subject: Winter Squashes Are Coming

So I wanted to send a note out to give you a heads up about some big changes coming up.

Our CEO has decided to confront Squysh head on, and so we're going to
be introducing our new line of Uber Melon Winter Squashes in just 10 days.

As you know, our CEO has invested billions of VC money in our robotic production and
delivery chain.  It's all managed by the code in "shipping_procedure.py".  It works 
great with our existing Melon classes- but can you check to see what we need to change 
in the `shipping_procedure.py` file so that it can handle Squashes, in addition to 
Melons?

Our Uber Melon Winter Squashes have a very unique prep procedure. Our CEO has
decided it would be best to paint them green with black stripes (his favorite color 
scheme) before shipment. The issue is that currently, the robots out in the factory 
are not painting the squashes since we never had to do that for watermelons.  As such,
the robots are rejecting the squash because they don't match the color scheme.

So, please update the robot control script (which you'll find in `robots.py`) 
as needed so that it does paint the squashes correctly. To invoke the paint bot that's 
already been installed at the factory, you can call the following function:
    
    robots.PainterBot.watermelonize(melon)

Lastly, we anticipate a few more classes of specialty melons in the near future. Kobe 
Melons, Tanzanian Devil Squashes, Lobster Melons, and the ever popular Micro Musk Melon 
are just a few examples of what's possible.

So, please make sure the code can cleanly accommodate new products like these, without 
requiring us to drastically modify the code too much each time we need to add a new 
product, and any distinct prep procedures our new products might need.

P.S. I've been told that any changes to the robot control script ("robots.py") would 
cost us hundreds of millions in contract fees to get implemented, so I'm hoping you can
do this without changing that file at all!

Thanks for your help,
Mel
